Universal Control Remapper

Currently just an experiment with dynamic GUIs

The V2 code has no library dependencies but uses the test AHK v2 binaries from here: http://ahkscript.org/boards/viewtopic.php?f=37&t=2998

#Dev notes.

Roadmap to UCR:
* Window Manager?   
Test code written for AHK v2, maybe over-complicated?   
Just display one plugin at a time?   
C application as parent, handle windowing with C libs?
* Dynamic Includes   
AutoHotkey.dll?   
DynaRun?   
* Full stick support   
sjc1000 taking a look at writing DirectInput wrapper.   
* vJoy interface   
New library written.
