0.0.4 - 24th Jan 2016
+ Profile Switcher plugin added to allow changing profile using a hotkey.
  This can be placed in the global profile to always be in effect.
+ Basic Joystick Axis to Button remapper plugin added.
+ Settings file is now written after one second's inactivity, rather than on every change.
+ Fix for Gui getting "Lost" when you minimized it.
  If this happened to you, edit your INI file and reset the x and y coordinates at the top to 0.
+ vJoy API calls optimized.
= State property added to Output GuiControls, to match input GuiControls.
= AHK_H version updated
= Objects which are used in multiple threads are shared via COM using new AHK_H function ObjShare().


0.0.3 - 3rd Jan 2016
! WARNING: The Mouse To Joystick plugin is DANGEROUS in this version.
  Adding one can be tricky (You will have to use keyboard to manipulate the Output Axis Combos)...
  ... But once you have added one, it will effectively break UCR - crashes all over the place :(
  You will also not be able to remove the plugin via the GUI.
= AHK_H version updated
= Mouse Delta input now fires InputEvent like the other inputs
= InputEvent callbacks are now "Critical Objects".
  Input from the global profile at the same time as the active profile should no longer crash UCR.
= Spamming button inputs quickly should no longer result in a "MaxHotkeysPerInterval" warning.
= Fix for current profile being forgotten on exit.
= Fix for multiple AxisToAxis plugins all using same output.

0.0.2 - 31st Dec 2015
= AHK_H version updated
+ Button To Axis remapper plugin added. Allows mapping of WSAD to vJoy
+ MouseDelta library added for reading of Delta Move information from mice.
+ Mouse to Joystick remapper plugin added for controlling a vJoy stick using mouse.
= Fix for: Leak of memory on each input event (eg button down/up, axis move).
= When in Bind Mode, only joystick buttons and hats that actually exist are polled.
  This is better practice, and also seems to solve crashes on some systems.
= Split plugins folder into Core and User folders.
  This should allow easier upgrading if you have your own plugins.
* If upgrading, it is advised that you back up your INI file and delete the old folder.

0.0.1 - 25th Dec 2015
+ First versioned release
