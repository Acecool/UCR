0.0.17 - 11th Sept 2016
+ There is now a "Main Menu" at the top of the UCR GUI.
  It has limited functionality for now, namely:
  Minimize To Tray - Hides the Taskbar icon when UCR is minimized
  Start Minimized - Minimizes UCR when it starts up.
  Show Joystick Names - Attempts to get the names for your connected sticks.
     This was crashing for some users, so now it is optional and disabled by default.
     This option requires restarting UCR to take effect.
+ New menu system implemented for Bind Controls.
  It is now much quicker to select Inputs / Outputs, and easier for me to add new options.
+ Added AxisInitializer plugin.
  This can be used to initialize a virtual axis to a specified position.
  Whenever the profile containing the plugin activates, it will set the axis position.
+ All Input / Output GuiControls now have a GUID at run-time
  This GUID is currently not saved between runs, but it can be if needed.
  This allows plugins that subscribe to InputActivity to detect how many buttons are held.
= OneSwitch Pulse plugin fixes:
  The "Choice" InputButton has been removed, as any UCR input coulds as a Choice...
  ... so it served no useful purpose, and could cause problems...
  ... if it and a ButtonToButton in the same profile were both mapped to the same thing.
  Now correctly stops pulsing if a second button is pressed and released...
  ...while one button is held.
  Now correctly suspends pulsing for the <Choice Delay> time on joystick axis activity.

0.0.16 - 14th Aug 2016
+ The ButtonToButton plugin now has a Toggle mode
+ MouseToJoy plugin enhancements:
  Added Scale Factor to Absolute mode.
  Plugin can now be configured to only take input from a specific mouse.
  You can now use multiple MouseToJoy plugins if you have more than one pointing device.
+ Added "HoldButton" functionality to OneSwitch Pulse plugin.
= InputActivity subscriptions no longer fire if the plugin is not active.
  This only really affects OneSwitch Pulse or any custom plugins using InputActivity.
= Fixed bug that occurred when changing an InputButton plugin from button to hat:
  The old binding was remaining active, this is now fixed.
= Fixed bug that occurred when changing an InputButton from keyboard to vJoy:
  The vJoy selection UI would change selection of various elements in odd ways.
= A bunch of behind-the-scenes changes and fixes.
  Please let me know if stuff that used to work now doesn't.
= MouseToJoy plugin fixes:
  Fixed numerous bugs which made Absolute mode center the stick way too much.
  The Timeout value for Absolute mode now works.

0.0.15 - 24th July 2016
! All ProfileSwitcher plugins will no longer be bound to a profile.
  You are advised to delete and re-add the plugin.
+ Dialogs to choose name of new Profile / Plugin now appear in the center of the UCR GUI.
+ A new custom GuiControl - the ProfileSelect is now available for Plugin Authors to use.
  This allows you to provide a guicontrol for users to choose a profile.
+ There is now a Text-To-Speech library provided in UCR.Libraries.TTS
+ Added Profile Speaker plugin.
  This can be used to speak something when a profile becomes active.
+ The OneSwitch Pulse plugin now makes a beep on toggle on/off.
+ The OneSwitch Pulse plugin now has a "Timeout Warning" setting.
= The recommended development environment for UCR is now AHK Studio
  Debugging of UCR and it's plugins is now much simpler.
  See the UCR wiki for info on debugging plugins.
  The code is now also split out into one file per class, so should be easier to work with.
= When you enter Bind Mode, the OnInActive() method is now called on all active plugins.
  All plugins should cease all activity on OnInActive() and resume on OnActive()
= The code of the ProfileSwitcher plugin is now vastly simplified.
  Most of it's code was moved into the ProfileSelect GuiControl.

0.0.14 - 19th June 2016
! INI (Settings) file format changed to 0.0.5. UCR will attempt to upgrade for you.
  YOU ARE ADVISED TO BACK UP YOUR UCR.INI BEFORE RUNNING THIS VERSION.
+ Adds new "Profile Inherits Plugins from parent" option to profiles.
  There is a new checkbox in the Profile Toolbox to turn this on or off for the current profile.
  If this option is on for a given profile, then when the profile is active...
  ... the profile's parent profile (if it has one) will also be active.
  This is useful when doing "Shift States", as it removes the need to duplicate plugins...
  ...in the "normal" and "shifted" profiles for things that don't change when shift is held.
= The Profile Switcher plugin now allows you to pick a profile for press and release.
  This was needed because two plugins in the same profile cannot be bound to the same button...
  ... so two profile pickers (one for press, one for release) bound tot he same button didn't work.
= Bindings to Mouse Wheel now properly simulate the up (release) event.
  Without this, if you remap mouse wheel to a key, that key is never released
= You can now control multiple vJoy sticks properly.
  Previously, UCR would only control one stick at a time, resulting in weird behaviour.
+ All pop-up windows / dialogs now appear in the center of the GUI.
= Numpad Enter is now bindable

0.0.13 - 21st May 2016
! INI (Settings) file format changed to 0.0.4. UCR will attempt to upgrade for you.
  YOU ARE ADVISED TO BACK UP YOUR UCR.INI BEFORE RUNNING THIS VERSION.
  If you have problems, please post on the forums.
= Plugins are now uniquely identified by IDs.
  This does not affect anything now, but it is an enabler for future features.
  eg: Renaming of plugins, moving plugins between profiles, inter-plugin communication.
= All IDs (Profile and Plugin) are now GUIDs generated via windows APIs
+ Status of Input Threads is now show in the Profile Toolbox.
  Blue = current profile, Green = active (eg global), Amber = Loaded but paused
= Fixes to logic for loading / unloading of Input Threads
= Up event for joystick buttons should now properly trigger...
  ... when entering a profile with the button already held.
+ UCR should now wait until done saving if you close the GUI mid-save.
+ Profile Toolbox now has a title in the GUI

0.0.12 - 17th May 2016
+ The Profile Toolbox is now integrated into the rest of the UI
  The UI is now resizable horizontally, so you can resize the profile toolbox.

0.0.11 - 10th May 2016
= The following keyboard keys are now bindable as inputs / outputs:
  PgUp, PgDn, End, Home, Left, Up, Right, Down, Insert, Delete
  Please note that some of your existingly configured bindings may change.
  eg Any binding set to NumpadLeft will now be Left arrow.
  This can be fixed by simply re-binding.

0.0.10 - 4th May 2016
+ The ProfileSwitcher plugin now has a "Press/Release" option.
  This controls whether the profile switch happens on press or release of the button.
  You can use this to switch to another profile when you press a button...
  ... then switch back to the original profile when you release the button.

0.0.9 - 3rd May 2016
= Fixed Issue #83
  The up event for a joystick button did not fire while a subsequently held button...
  ... was down, until you released the button.
  eg Hold button A, then B. Up event for A would not fire until B was released.
= Fixed Issue #84
  Output buttons were registering as Input buttons.

0.0.8 - 1st May 2016
+ Added memory management for profile Input Threads
  The "Input Threads" which handle detection of input (one for each profile)...
  ... now start and stop dynamically as profiles change.
  This is to limit the amount of memory UCR uses to a reasonable level.
  A Profile's Input Thread will now be unloaded on profile change if they are a ...
  ... "Linked Profile" of the new profile or the global profile.
  Profile A is considered a "Linked Profile" of Profile B if eg...
  ... a Profile Switcher plugin in Profile B is configured to point to Profile A.
  Plugins can call UpdateLinkedProfiles() on the parent Profile...
  ... to set their relationship to other Profiles (Add or remove a link).
= All debug output now prefixed with UCR|
  So if using DebugView, you can just filter for only UCR stuff using the string:
  DBGVIEWCLEAR;UCR|*

0.0.7 - 13th Mar 2016
! Warning! Settings version has changed.
  BACK UP your INI file before using it with this version, if you value it.
+ Profiles are now organized in a Tree instead of a flat list.
+ Added a "Profile Toolbox" to allow navigation of the profile tree.
  Add / Add Child / Delete / Rename of profiles are all functional.
  Dragging and dropping of items in the Profile Tree to change parenting or order is supported.
+ Profile Switcher plugin now has a "picker" that can be used to choose a profile from the tree.
  If you later change the structure of the tree, it will still point to the same profile.
! Both the "Profile Toolbox" and the "Profile Picker" are experimental / placeholder.
  The Profile Picker does not close unless you pick an item or close it.
  Neither remember position or size.
= Multiple AxisMerge plugins can now be used together.

0.0.6 - 21st Feb 2016
= Fixed errors while switching profile at the same time as input was happening.
  The ProfileSwitcher plugin should no longer crash UCR.

0.0.5 - 25th Jan 2016
= On change of profile, all held buttons are released.
= AxisToButton plugins now correctly manipulate the outputs.
= Multiple AxisToButton plugins now work together.

0.0.4 - 24th Jan 2016
+ Profile Switcher plugin added to allow changing profile using a hotkey.
  This can be placed in the global profile to always be in effect.
+ Basic Joystick Axis to Button remapper plugin added.
+ Settings file is now written after one second's inactivity, rather than on every change.
+ Fix for Gui getting "Lost" when you minimized it.
  If this happened to you, edit your INI file and reset the x and y coordinates at the top to 0.
+ vJoy API calls optimized.
= State property added to Output GuiControls, to match input GuiControls.
= AHK_H version updated
= Objects which are used in multiple threads are shared via COM using new AHK_H function ObjShare().


0.0.3 - 3rd Jan 2016
! WARNING: The Mouse To Joystick plugin is DANGEROUS in this version.
  Adding one can be tricky (You will have to use keyboard to manipulate the Output Axis Combos)...
  ... But once you have added one, it will effectively break UCR - crashes all over the place :(
  You will also not be able to remove the plugin via the GUI.
= AHK_H version updated
= Mouse Delta input now fires InputEvent like the other inputs
= InputEvent callbacks are now "Critical Objects".
  Input from the global profile at the same time as the active profile should no longer crash UCR.
= Spamming button inputs quickly should no longer result in a "MaxHotkeysPerInterval" warning.
= Fix for current profile being forgotten on exit.
= Fix for multiple AxisToAxis plugins all using same output.

0.0.2 - 31st Dec 2015
= AHK_H version updated
+ Button To Axis remapper plugin added. Allows mapping of WSAD to vJoy
+ MouseDelta library added for reading of Delta Move information from mice.
+ Mouse to Joystick remapper plugin added for controlling a vJoy stick using mouse.
= Fix for: Leak of memory on each input event (eg button down/up, axis move).
= When in Bind Mode, only joystick buttons and hats that actually exist are polled.
  This is better practice, and also seems to solve crashes on some systems.
= Split plugins folder into Core and User folders.
  This should allow easier upgrading if you have your own plugins.
* If upgrading, it is advised that you back up your INI file and delete the old folder.

0.0.1 - 25th Dec 2015
+ First versioned release
