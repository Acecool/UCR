########## Required before public testing can begin ############
Make BindMode thread run multi-threaded again

Re-Enable profiles

Wire up the SetState outputs for keyboard / mouse

Only Buttons seem to cause vGen to Acquire

Add vXBox hat

Make all GuiControls use the GuiControls array in the INI file. Avoid spamming with empty InputDeltas, ProfileSelects etc for each plugin

Re-Add all the plugins

Add Titan API back in

Take a look at encoding of hat directions.
ATM, input is AHK Joy only, so only 1 hat, so Binding[1] can hold hat direction
for multi-hat IOClasses (eg vGen), this is currently encoded as (HatNum * 100) + Dir (eg 101, 201, 301, 401 for North of each 4 hats).
This requires some processing at run-time that could maybe be avoided by adding an extra property to that IOClass
