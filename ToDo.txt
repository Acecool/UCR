Not relinquishing when switching from vXBox to vJoy

Take a look at encoding of hat directions.
ATM, input is AHK Joy only, so only 1 hat, so Binding[1] can hold hat direction
for multi-hat IOClasses (eg vGen), this is currently encoded as (HatNum * 100) + Dir (eg 101, 201, 301, 401 for North of each 4 hats).
This requires some processing at run-time that could maybe be avoided by adding an extra property to that IOClass
