In UCR.ChangeProfile, at each iteration through new_profile_states, clone it and remove items from list.
No point in processing each profile more than once

Saw Orphaned profile in Barrie's INI. Not sure how it happened. Investigate
Mitigation: Add Telemetry to UCR. Number of profiles, active threads, etc. Statusbar?
This will assist in detecting when a profile has become orphaned etc.

BuildProfilePathName getting called sometimes for a profile when it's parent has not loaded because it cannot get the parent profile.
Repro:
Profile 111 is a child of 333
Profile 222 has a ProfileSwitcher that points to 111
Profile 111 loads
Profile 222 loads, ProfileSwitcher points to 111, so it looks up 111 (Loaded)
It needs to build path to root, so as 111 is a child of 333, it looks up the name of 333 = Boom (333 not loaded).
Something like this may also be able to cause orphaned profiles?
Resolution:
Are likely to always be able to cause problems like this. Will have to load all profiles, then have ProfileSwitchers update path.
Already mechanism to force path update, UCR.FireProfileTreeChangeCallbacks()
Also should maybe load profiles top-down by iterating obj.ProfileTree, instead of obj.Profiles?

IOControl DeviceID sometimes seems to get set to 0
Seen with various output types (vJoy, Titan) - not sure on whether it happens with input types.
Generally clearing binding and/or restarting UCR works around.

Implement "Pause Button" to DeActivate all profiles.
Needs to cater for the situation where we are "Paused" and enter Bind Mode.
Once Bind Mode ends, it needs to know to not re-activate profiles
Also, some visual / audible feedback should be given to let the user know that UCR is paused

Implement Mouse to Keyboard.
Extend Mouse To Joystick?

Investigate effect of saving on performance - esp big pauses.
Suspect calling serialize on all objects locks them up and causes problems.
Cache values? Move to random access storage? SQLite?
Plugin _OnInactive can no longer release held buttons

Profile Inheritance option not always showing in Profile Toolbox
Try adding menus to profiles and putting option in there?

Custom Serializers / Deserializers for IOClasses? Would also reduce INI file spam

Joystick button bindings need to be turned off for outputbuttons
When suspend, off happens, these become active even though they are not wanted.
Non-fatal as the bind handler does not accept them
Just add filter? Check if return type is not in mappings, and if so, do not fire callback

Remove _InputHandler?

Take a look at encoding of hat directions.
ATM, input is AHK Joy only, so only 1 hat, so Binding[1] can hold hat direction
for multi-hat IOClasses (eg vGen), this is currently encoded as (HatNum * 100) + Dir (eg 101, 201, 301, 401 for North of each 4 hats).
This requires some processing at run-time that could maybe be avoided by adding an extra property to that IOClass
Move Hat# to BindOptions?

IsEmptyAssoc in Plugin not working? GuiControls always in INI even if empty

From old ToDo:
* Sort out _RequestBinding / _RefreshBinding - may already be done?
